### 2. Basic Plots

This section focuses on fundamental plot types that are commonly used in data visualization. It includes:
- **Line Plots:** For visualizing trends over time or continuous data.
- **Bar Plots:** Useful for comparing quantities across different categories.
- **Pie Charts:** For showing proportions of categories in a dataset.
- **Examples & Plots:** Each plot type is demonstrated with real data examples and visual outputs.

### 3. Advanced Plots

In this section, more complex plots are explored, which are useful for detailed data analysis. It covers:
- **Scatter Plots:** To visualize the relationship between two variables.
- **Histograms:** For displaying the distribution of a dataset.
- **Box Plots:** To summarize the distribution of a dataset by showing its quartiles.
- **Violin Plots:** For understanding the distribution of data, combining the properties of box plots and KDE.
- **Heatmaps:** To visualize matrix-like data or relationships between variables.
- **Examples & Plots:** Advanced plot types are demonstrated with datasets, along with their visual outputs.
